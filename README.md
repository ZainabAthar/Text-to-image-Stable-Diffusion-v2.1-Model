# Stable Diffusion on Vertex AI

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the deployment of a **Stable Diffusion model** on **Google Cloud Vertex AI** to generate high-quality images from textual descriptions. The workflow involves model deployment, text-to-image inference, and visualization of results.

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the process:

## Features

- **Model Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy the Stable Diffusion model on Vertex AI.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Generate realistic images from textual prompts.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Leverage the power of Vertex AI for scalable and efficient inference.
- **Workflow Automation**: Includes a streamlined pipeline for text input to image output.

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. A Google Cloud account with Vertex AI enabled.
2. Properly configured `gcloud` CLI.
3. A Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.


## Workflow

- **Input**: User provides a textual description.
- **Processing**: The deployed Stable Diffusion model on Vertex AI processes the input and generates an image.
- **Output**: The generated image is returned and saved for further use.
